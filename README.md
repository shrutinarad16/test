## Project Moto
**Building with Polygon Bridge**


Imagine that you are working on a large NFT project. Your team decided to move your project to Polygon to increase demand and save on gas. Now it's your job to make this happen!


For this project, you will deploy an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, Map the collection to Polygon, and Transfer assets over via the Polygon Bridge. To put a twist on the project, use an image generation tool - like DALLE 2 or Midjourney - to the images for your NFTs.
